# NeoPixel Library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel)

Arduino library for controlling single-wire-based LED pixels and strip such as on the PiBot.  In the PiBot pioneers repo (config directory) there are scripts to install this automatically into the Arduion IDE's library folder.

This repo is adapted from the AdafruitNeoPixel Library and examples.
